<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br/>Effective date: [Month DD, 2025]</p>

<p>CalcAI (“we”, “us”) builds and sells modified calculators that connect to cloud AI features. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, what we do not collect, how we use information, and your choices.</p>

<h2>What we collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Order and contact info</strong> you submit during checkout (handled by Poof), such as name, email, and shipping region.</li>
  <li><strong>Device and service logs</strong> when enabled by you or necessary to operate the service, including device MAC address, timestamp, and limited diagnostic messages.</li>
  <li><strong>AI usage data</strong> when you use CalcAI’s cloud features: prompts you send, the AI’s responses, and—if you capture an image for analysis—the image. For performance and storage efficiency, we keep <em>the latest image per device</em> and log prompts/responses with timestamps.</li>
  <li><strong>SMS data</strong> for restock alerts: your phone number, consent status (checkbox), consent IP and timestamp, and subscription status (subscribed/unsubscribed).</li>
  <li><strong>Basic site analytics</strong> (e.g., pages visited, approximate region) using standard web analytics tools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we do <em>not</em> collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Wi‑Fi credentials.</strong> We do not receive your Wi‑Fi network name (SSID) or Wi‑Fi password. Those are configured locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>No account passwords.</strong> We do not collect your school, email, or other third‑party account usernames or passwords.</li>
  <li><strong>No full payment card data.</strong> Payments are processed by Poof; we do not store full card numbers or CVCs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we use information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Provide and improve CalcAI.</strong> Operate the devices and website; troubleshoot; prevent abuse; and improve reliability and quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud AI features.</strong> Route your prompts/images to the AI provider you use (e.g., OpenAI) and return results to your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Restock alerts.</strong> If you opt in, send SMS messages about availability. You can reply STOP to unsubscribe or HELP for help.</li>
  <li><strong>Updates and safety.</strong> Manage optional firmware updates and apply security fixes. We may publish or deliver updates that change functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal and compliance.</strong> Comply with applicable law and enforce our Terms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who we share with</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AI providers</strong> (for cloud features), such as OpenAI. Your prompts/images/outputs are processed under their terms and privacy policies.</li>
  <li><strong>SMS provider</strong> (Twilio) to deliver text messages and manage STOP/HELP keywords.</li>
  <li><strong>Payments</strong> (Poof) to process transactions. Poof’s terms and privacy policy apply to payment processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting/infra</strong> providers that help us run the website and APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Law enforcement</strong> when required by law.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Order/payment meta (non‑card):</strong> retained as required for tax/accounting.</li>
  <li><strong>Diagnostic/device logs:</strong> typically retained up to 90 days, then deleted or rotated.</li>
  <li><strong>AI prompts/responses:</strong> retained up to 90 days for troubleshooting and quality; images: we keep the latest image per device.</li>
  <li><strong>SMS subscriptions:</strong> kept until you unsubscribe; STOP will mark the number unsubscribed. We may retain an audit trail of consent/unsubscribe events.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SMS opt out:</strong> reply STOP to any CalcAI text to unsubscribe; reply START to resubscribe.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete request:</strong> you can request deletion of device logs, prompts/responses, and the latest stored image for your device. We will verify ownership (e.g., via order info/device MAC) and then delete where feasible.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not send secrets:</strong> Avoid submitting private or sensitive information in prompts/images you do not want processed by cloud AI providers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>CalcAI is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. No method is 100% secure. Keep your device software up to date.</p>

<h2>International transfers</h2>
<p>Your information may be processed in the United States and other locations where our providers operate.</p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the new policy with a new effective date.</p>
