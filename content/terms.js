We sell calculators we have modified, and/or we modify devices you send to us. Modifications may include microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32), camera modules, firmware, and case work. Software &amp; AI connectivity. Our products can connect to cloud AI services (e.g., “ChatGPT‑style” assistants). Some features need Wi‑Fi and an AI provider account or API key. Not a TI or OpenAI product. CalcAI is not affiliated with Texas Instruments, OpenAI, College Board, ETS, ACT, or any test authority. Trademarks belong to their owners.
